# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.
`gh` infers the repo from `git remote -v` when run inside a clone.

> **If this repo also has a Gitea agent work tracker**, GitHub is the **intake**
> surface only: humans and community file here, and skills read and triage these
> issues but never open new work tickets on them. New specs, tickets, and maps go to
> the agent work tracker.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for
  multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'`
  with `--label` / `--state` filters as needed.
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Robot comments

A comment a skill posts on an issue or PR opens with a stable **marker** line:

> 🤖 `<skill-name>` — <purpose>

(skill name in backticks; one purpose per marker, e.g. ``🤖 `triage` — triage notes``).
Markers make re-runs idempotent: before posting, read the item's comments and look for
your marker — found, edit that comment in place; not found, post fresh. One live
marker comment per skill and purpose; anything parsing comments keys on the marker
text, never on the emoji alone.

- **Find yours**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`; for comment IDs,
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/comments --jq '.[] | {id, body}'`
- **Edit in place**: `gh issue comment <number> --edit-last --body "..."` when the
  marker comment is your latest on the item; otherwise
  `gh api --method PATCH repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/comments/<comment-id> -f body='...'`

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as
feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the
`gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments`, plus `gh pr diff <number>`.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`,
  then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or
  `NONE` (drop `OWNER` / `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR`). That filter is what "external"
  means for this repo.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label` / `--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either —
resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue — **unless** this repo is intake-only (see the note at the top),
in which case publish to the agent work tracker instead.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Destination / Notes /
  Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the
  sub-issues endpoint). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list
  in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels:
  `wayfinder:<type>` (`research` / `prototype` / `grilling` / `task`).
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**. Add an edge with
  `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`,
  where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id**
  (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`) — _not_ the `#number` or
  `node_id`. GitHub reports open blockers in `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by`.
  Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at
  the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker or
  an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`,
  then append a one-line gist plus link to the map's Decisions-so-far.
